### Lesson 03.06
#### Number Guessing Game
In this lesson we will write a number guessing game program:
- Player clicks PLAY button to call **playGame** function
- **playGame** function hides the PLAY button and
- shows the input box for entering guess
- shows the GUESS button for submitting guess
- shows an h2 for displaying feedback
- Program generates a mystery random integer from 1-100
- Player inputs a number by typing or using stepper arrows
- Player clicks GUESS button to call **evalGuess** function
- **evalGuess** function compares guess to mystery number
- feedback is displayed: Too High or Too Low or Congrats
- function keeps track of total guesses
- Once the mystery number is guessed:
- the score (Games Played and Guess Avg) is updated
- the **resetGame** function is called automatically

#### resetGame function:
- updates the score
- shows playBtn; hides guessBox, guessBtn and feedback
- We are ready for a new game: click PLAY AGAIN

1. Declare game play variables. These need to be in the global scope, since the vars are used by more than one function.

    ```js
    let r = guess = guesses = games = avg = 0;
    ```
The above shorthand requires that the variables have the same initial value, in this case zero.

24. Declare an empty array for storing guesses, so that we can notify the player if they've already guessed that number:

    ```js
    const guessesArr = [];
    ```

2. Get the PLAY and GUESS buttons (GUESS is hidden on page load):

    ```js
    const playBtn = document.getElementById('play-btn');
    const guessBtn = document.getElementById('guess-btn');
    ```

3. Have the buttons call their respective functions:

    ```js
    playBtn.addEventListener('click', playGame);
    guessBtn.addEventListener('click', evalGuess);
    ```

4. Get the guess input box and feedback h2, both of which are also hidden on page load:

    ```js
    const guessBox = document.querySelector('input');
    const feedbackH2 = document.getElementById('feedback');
    ```

5. Get the footer spans for keeping score:

    ```js
    const gamesSpan = document.getElementById("games-span");
    const guessesSpan = document.getElementById("guesses-span");
    const avgSpan = document.getElementById("avg-span");
    ```

The playGame function runs when the PLAY button is clicked. 

6. Declare the playGame function:

    ```js
    function playGame() {
    ```
        
    7. Generate a random mystery number from 1-100:

        ```js
        r = Math.ceil(Math.random() * 100);
        console.log('mystery number:', r);
        ```

    8. Hide the PLAY button

        ```js
        this.style.display = "none";
        ```

     9. Show the guess input box, GUESS button and feedback h2:

        ```js
        guessBox.style.display = "inline";
        guessBtn.style.display = "inline";
        feedbackH2.style.display = "inline-block";
        ```

    10. Output a prompt to the feedback h2:

    ```js
        feedbackH2.textContent = "Guess the mystery number from 1-100";

    } // end function playGame()
    ```
    
The evalGuess function runs when GUESS button is clicked. 

- if the guess is too low, output: "Guess is too LOW"
- else if the guess is too high, output: "Guess is too HIGH"
- else guess is correct, so "Congrats!" (Game Over)
- the resetGame() function is called when the game is over


11. Declare the playGame function:

    ```js
    function evalGuess() {
    ```

    13. Get the player's guess from the input box and convert it to an actual number:

        ```js
        guess = Number(guessBox.value);
        ```

    25. Check if the player's new guess is already in guessesArr, and if so tell player to guess another number--but don't "charge" them for a guess:

    ```js
        if(guessesArr.includes(guess)) {
            feebackH2.innerHTML = `Oops! You already guessed ${guess}!<br>Try another number!`;

        } else {

    ```

    12. Increase guesses by 1

        ```js
        guesses++;
        ```

    14. If the guess is less than the mystery number:

        ```js
        if(guess < r) { 
            feedbackH2.textContent = "Guess is too LOW!";
        ```
            
    15. If the guess is greater than the mystery number:

        ```js
        } else if(guess > r) {
            feedbackH2.textContent = "Guess is too HIGH!";
        ```

    16. If neither too high nor too low, the guess is correct:

        ```js
        } else {
            feedbackH2.innerHTML = `Congrats! You guessed<br>the mystery number: ${r}`;
        ```

    17. Game's over, so call the resetGame function:
           
    ```js
            resetGame();
        }
    } // outer if-else
        
    } // end function evalGuess()
    ```

The resetGame function runs automatically when the player guesses correctly.

18. Declare the playGame function:

    ```js
    function resetGame() {
    ```

    19. Reset the player guess and guess input box to 0:

        ```js
        guess = 0;
        guessBox.value = 0;
        ```

    20. Increment total games played by 1

        ```js
        games++;
        ```
    
    21. Hide the guess input box and guess button:

        ```js
        guessBox.style.display = "none";
        guessBtn.style.display = "none";
        ```

    22. Show playBtn; this time have it say PLAY AGAIN:

        ```js
        playBtn.style.display = "inline-block";
        playBtn.textContent = "PLAY AGAIN";
        ```

    23. Update the Guesses, Games Played and Guess Avg:

    ```js
        gamesSpan.textContent = games;
        avgSpan.textContent = (guesses / games).toFixed(2);

    } // end function resetGame()
    ```
