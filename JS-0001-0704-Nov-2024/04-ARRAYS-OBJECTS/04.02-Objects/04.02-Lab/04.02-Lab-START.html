                In the object variable declaration, include the 
                following properties of indicated key and datatype
                For the values, refer to the method's return value

            product object's properties: key (datatype)
                - prodName (string)
                - patentNum (number)
                - assemblyRequired (boolean)

                - company (object with 2 properties: name, country)
                - promote (method) the returns a string concatenated
                from ALL the other properties and array items:
                promote method returns:

        3. Add four new properties outside of the object. In other words, do not add

           - The promote method's updated return value should be:
