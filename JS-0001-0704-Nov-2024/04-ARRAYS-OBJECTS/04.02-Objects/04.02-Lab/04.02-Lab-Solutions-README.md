### Making an Object with Properties 
### Adding a Method (function) to an Object
### Updating / Setting Object Properties

1. Make an object variable called product. 
- In the object variable declaration, include the following properties of indicated key and datatype.
- For the values, refer to the method's return value

- product object's properties: key (datatype)
    - prodName (string)
    - patentNum (number)
    - assemblyRequired (boolean)
    - buzzwords (array with 3 items)
    - company (object with 2 properties: name, country
    - promote (method) the returns a string concatenated
    from ALL the other properties and array items:
    promote method returns:
    "Announcing Doo-Dad Incorporated's newest high-tech, labor-saving, 
    water-resistant Wonder Widget! Made in U.S.A. Patent number: 7654321.
    Some assembly required."
    HINT: Use if-else logic in the method to concatnate or not based on the boolean

```js
    const product = {
        prodName: 'Wonder Widget',
        patentNum: 7654321,
        assemblyRequired: true,
        buzzwords: ['high-tech', 'labor-saving', 'water-resistant'],
        company: {name: "Doo-Dad, Inc.", country: "U.S.A."},
        promote: function() {
            let assembly = "";
            if(this.assemblyRequired) assembly = "Some assembly required.";
            return `\Get ${this.company.name}'s new ${this.buzzwords[0]}, ${this.buzzwords[1]}, ${this.buzzwords[this.buzzwords.length-1]} ${this.prodName}! 
            \nMade in ${this.company.country}. Patent number: ${this.patentNum}. ${assembly}`
        }
    }
```

2. Log the following properties of the object:

    - the whole object
    - the boolean, including with it the label "Assembly Required:"
    - the first item in the buzzwords array
    - the last item in buzzwords, accessed via the array length
    - the company name and country as: "All Doo-Dad, Inc. products are made in U.S.A."
    - the promote method: 
    Get Doo-Dad Inc.'s new high-tech, labor-saving, water-resistant Wonder Widget! 
    Made in U.S.A. Patent number: 7654321. Some assembly required.

```js
    console.log(product); // {} (click arrow to open and see all properties)
    console.log("Assembly Required:", product.assemblyRequired); // Assembly Required: true
    console.log(product.buzzwords[0]); // high-tech
    console.log(product.buzzwords[product.buzzwords.length-1]); // water-resistant
    console.log(`All ${product.company.name} products are made in ${product.company.country}`);
    // All Doo-Dad, Inc. products are made in U.S.A.
    console.log(product.promote()); 
    // Get Doo-Dad Inc.'s new high-tech, labor-saving, water-resistant Wonder Widget! 
    // Made in U.S.A. Patent number: 7654321. Some assembly required.
```

 3. Add four new properties outside of the object. In other words, do not add these new properites directly into the object declaration:
    - msrp (number) -- MSRP (Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price)
    - discount (number) -- as decimal: .2 means 20%
    - salePrice (result of math done with mspr and discount)
    - caution (string)

```js
    product.msrp = 40;
    product.discount = .2;
    product.salePrice = product.msrp * (1 - product.discount);
    product.caution = "Water-resistant does NOT mean waterproof. Do not submerge.";
```

4. Update the promote method to include the new properties. 
    - do not edit the original object method
    HINT: product.promote = function()
    - The promote method's updated return value should be:
    "Get Doo-Dad Inc.'s new high-tech, labor-saving, water-resistant Wonder Widget! Made in U.S.A. 
    Made in U.S.A. Patent number: 7654321. Some assembly required.
    MSRP: $40 * * * ON SALE! 20% OFF * * * NOW ONLY: $32 ***
    (CAUTION: Water-resistant does NOT mean waterproof. Do not submerge.)
    - log the promote method to see the changes.

```js
    product.promote = function() {
        let assembly = "";
        if(this.assemblyRequired) assembly = "Some assembly required";
        return `Get ${this.company.name}'s new ${this.buzzwords[0]}, 
        ${this.buzzwords[1]}, ${this.buzzwords[this.buzzwords.length-1]} ${this.prodName}! 
        Made in ${this.company.country}. Patent number: ${this.patentNum}. ${assembly} 
        *** MSRP: $${this.msrp} *** ON SALE! ${this.discount * 100}% OFF *** NOW ONLY: $${this.salePrice}`;
    }

    console.log(product.promote());
    // Get Doo-Dad Inc.'s new high-tech, labor-saving, water-resistant Wonder Widget! 
    // Made in U.S.A. Patent number: 7654321. Some assembly required.
    // *** MSRP: $40 *** ON SALE! $20% OFF *** NOW ONLY: $32;
```

5. Update / change properties and log the whole object and the method again:
    - flip the boolean to false
    - increase the MSRP to $75
    - increase the discount to 50%
    - push another buzzword into the array: "shock-resistant"
    - update the promote method to include the new array item
    - log the promote method to see the changes.

```js
    product.assemblyRequired = false;
    product.msrp = 75;
    product.discount = .5;
    product.buzzwords.push('shock-resistant');

    product.promote = function() {
        let assembly = "";
        if(this.assemblyRequired) assembly = "Some assembly required";
        return `Get ${this.company.name}'s new ${this.buzzwords[0]}, ${this.buzzwords[1]}, 
        ${this.buzzwords[2]}, ${this.buzzwords[this.buzzwords.length-1]} ${this.prodName}! 
        Made in ${this.company.country}. Patent number: ${this.patentNum}. ${assembly} 
        *** MSRP: $${this.msrp} *** ON SALE! ${this.discount * 100}% OFF *** NOW ONLY: $${this.salePrice}`;
    }

    console.log(product.promote());
    // Get Doo-Dad Inc.'s new high-tech, labor-saving, water-resistant, shock-resistant Wonder Widget! 
    // Made in U.S.A. Patent number: 7654321. Some assembly required.
    // *** MSRP: $75 *** ON SALE! $50% OFF *** NOW ONLY: $37.50;
