1. Continuing with the "timely greeting", adjust the logic so that:
- if the time is 6:00 pm - 10:59 pm, greeting is "Good Evening"
- if the time is 11:00 pm - 3:59 am, greeting is "Hey, Night Owl!"
- if the time is 4:00 pm - 11:59 am, greeting is "Good Morning!"
- if the time is 12:00 - 5:59 pm, greeting is "Good Afternoon!"
- all other greeting times are unchanged

    ```js
    let dt = new Date();
    let hr = dt.getHours();
    let greeting = 'Good ';

    if(hr < 4) {
        greeting = "Hey, Night Owl!";
    } else if(hr < 12) {
        greeting = "Good Morning!";
    } else if(hr < 18) {
        greeting = "Good Afternoon!";
    } else if(hr < 22) {
        greeting = "Good Evening!";
    } else { // hr is 23 (11:00-11:59pm)
        greeting = "Hey, Night Owl!";
    }
    ```

Output the greeting to the tag on the web page with an id="greeting"

    ```js
    const greetingTag = document.getElementById('greeting');
    console.log(greeting);
    greetingTag.textContent = greeting;
    ```

2. Make a "Activityies" link for each greeting
- Each activity should link to the provided URL 
- The a-tag is already on the thml page
- Set the href and the text for the a-tag in the same 
- if-else block that makes the greeting

- If the greeting is "Hey, Night Owl!", the link should say:
    -  "Night Owl Activities" and should link to:
    - https://newyorksimply.com/nyc-things-to-do-in-new-york-city-at-night

- If the greeting is "Good Morning!", the link should say:
    - "Morning Activities" and should link to:
    - https://nymag.com/guides/everything/early-morning-2014-1/
   
- If the greeting is "Good Afternoon!", the link should say:
    - "Afternoon Activities" and should link to:
    - https://www.theinfatuation.com/new-york/guides/best-afternoon-tea-nyc

- If the greeting is "Good Evening!", the link should say:
    - "Evening Activities" and should link to:
    - https://websterhall.com/shows/


    ```js
    let aTag = document.querySelector('a');

    let nightOwlURL = "https://newyorksimply.com/nyc-things-to-do-in-new-york-city-at-night";

    let morningURL = "https://nymag.com/guides/everything/early-morning-2014-1/";

    let afternoonURL = "https://www.theinfatuation.com/new-york/guides/best-afternoon-tea-nyc";

    let eveningURL = "https://websterhall.com/shows/";
    
    hr = 1; // testing hr

    if(hr < 4) {
        greeting = "Hey, Night Owl!";
        aTag.href = nightOwlURL;
        aTag.text = "Night Owl Activities";
    } else if(hr < 12) {
        greeting = "Good Morning!";
        aTag.href = morningURL;
        aTag.text = "Morning Activities";
    } else if(hr < 18) {
        greeting = "Good Afternoon!";
        aTag.href = afternoonURL;
        aTag.text = "Afternoon Activities";
    } else if(hr < 22) {
        greeting = "Good Evening!";
        aTag.href = eveningURL;
        aTag.text = "Evening Activities";
    } else { // hr is 23 (11:00-11:59pm)
        greeting = "Hey, Night Owl!";
        aTag.href = nightOwlURL;
        aTag.text = "Night Owl Activities";
    }

    console.log(greeting);
    greetingTag.textContent = greeting;
    ```

Test the output by hard-coding hr values. 
Sample hr values and their expected output
- When hr = 0, greeting is "Good Evening!"
- When hr = 3, greeting is "Hey, Night Owl!"
- When hr = 5, greeting is "Good Morning!"
- When hr = 15, greeting is "Good Afternoon!"
- When hr = 20, greeting is "Good Evening!"
