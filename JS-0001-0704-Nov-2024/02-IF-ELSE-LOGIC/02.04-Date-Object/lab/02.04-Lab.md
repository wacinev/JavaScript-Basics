1. Continuing with the "timely greeting", adjust the logic so that:
- if the time is 6:00 pm - 10:59 pm, greeting is "Good Evening"
- if the time is 11:00 pm - 3:59 am, greeting is "Hey, Night Owl!"
- if the time is 4:00 pm - 11:59 am, greeting is "Good Morning!"
- if the time is 12:00 - 5:59 pm, greeting is "Good Afternoon!"
- all other greeting times are unchanged

    ```js
    let dt;
    let greeting = 'Good ';
    ```

Output the greeting to the tag on the web page with an id="greeting"

    ```js
    console.log(greeting);
    ```

2. Make a "Activityies" link for each greeting
- Each activity should link to the provided URL 
- The a-tag is already on the thml page
- Set the href and the text for the a-tag in the same 
- if-else block that makes the greeting

- If the greeting is "Hey, Night Owl!", the link should say:
    -  "Night Owl Activities" and should link to:
    - https://newyorksimply.com/nyc-things-to-do-in-new-york-city-at-night

- If the greeting is "Good Morning!", the link should say:
    - "Morning Activities" and should link to:
    - https://nymag.com/guides/everything/early-morning-2014-1/
   
- If the greeting is "Good Afternoon!", the link should say:
    - "Afternoon Activities" and should link to:
    - https://www.theinfatuation.com/new-york/guides/best-afternoon-tea-nyc

- If the greeting is "Good Evening!", the link should say:
    - "Evening Activities" and should link to:
    - https://websterhall.com/shows/


    ```js
    let nightOwlURL = "https://newyorksimply.com/nyc-things-to-do-in-new-york-city-at-night";
    
    // hr = 1; // testing hr

    console.log(greeting);
    ```

Test the output by hard-coding hr values. 
Sample hr values and their expected output
- When hr = 0, greeting is "Good Evening!"
- When hr = 3, greeting is "Hey, Night Owl!"
- When hr = 5, greeting is "Good Morning!"
- When hr = 15, greeting is "Good Afternoon!"
- When hr = 20, greeting is "Good Evening!"
