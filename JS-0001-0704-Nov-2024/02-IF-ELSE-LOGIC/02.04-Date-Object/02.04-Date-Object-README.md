### Lesson 02.04

### The Date Object

- The **Date Object** is instantiated using the **new** keyword: **new Date()**.
- The Date Object returns the full date-time from the user's computer.
- The return value is saved as an **instance** (variable) of the Date Object.
- The instance is an object with all the Date Object's methods and properties.

1. Instantiate the Date Object, saving the returned object as **dateTime**:

  ```js
  let dateTime = new Date(); 
  console.log(dateTime); // Mon Mar 27 2023 11:08:04 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)
  ```

The individual time units are accessible via the Date object's "get methods".

2. Get the current hour, minute and second:

  ```js
  let hour = dateTime.getHours();
  console.log(hour); // 0-23

  let minute = dateTime.getMinutes();
  console.log(minute); // 0-59

  let second = dateTime.getSeconds();
  console.log(second); // 0-59
  ```

3. Express the time in 00:00:00 format:

  ```js
  let hourMinSec = `${hour}:${minute}:${second}`;
  console.log(timeIs); // 11:8:4
  ```

#### adding leading zeroes to minute and second

If minute and/or second are less than 10, the time says 11:8:4, not 11:08:04. To fix this, add leading zeros to minute and second, as needed. This is done with conditional logic.

4. I minute or second are less than 10, set the variable equal to itself with a '0' concatenated in front:

  ```js
  if(minute < 10) {
    minute = '0' + minute;
  }

  if(second < 10) {
    second = '0' + second;
  }
  
  hourMinSec = `${hour}:${minute}:${second}`;
  console.log(timeIs); // 11:08:04
  ```

Whenever there is only one line of code inside the curly braces of an "if statement", you can delete the curly braces, and put it all onto the same line.

5. Comment out the above "if statements" and re-write them as one-liners:

  ```js
  if(minute < 10) minute = '0' + minute;
  if(second < 10) second = '0' + second;
  
  hourMinSec = `${hour}:${minute}:${second}`;
  console.log(hourMinSec); // 11:08:04

  // the easy way to get the time, w the leading 0 and AM / PM:
  let en_US_Time = dateTime.toLocaleTimeString('en-US');
  console.log('en_US_Time:', en_US_Time); // 2:48:04 PM

  ```


### Making a "Timely Greeting"

Let's make a "timely greeting", one which is appropriate for the time of day.

- **if** the hour is less than 12, say "Good morning!"
- **else if** the hour is less than 18 (6:00pm), say "Good afternoon!"
- **else**, say "Good Evening!"


8. Declare greeting in the global scope as an empty string. It's value will be set by the "if else" logic.

  ```js
  let greeting = "Good ";
  ```

9. If the current hour is less than 12 (noon), set the greeting to "Good Morning!":

  ```js
  if(hour < 12) {
      greeting += "Morning!";
  } 
  ```

10. If the current hour is NOT less than 12, but it IS less than 17 (5:00 PM), set the greeting to "Good Afternoon!":

  ```js
  if (hour < 12) {
    greeting += "Morning!";
  } else if (hour < 17) {
    greeting += "Afternoon!";
  } 
  ```  

11. If both of these conditions are false, then the the current hour must be in the 18-23 range, that is, 6:00 PM or later. So set the greeting to "Good Afternoon!":

    ```js
    if (hour < 12) {
      greeting += "Morning!";
    } else if (h < 18) {
      greeting += "Afternoon!";
    } else {
      greeting += "Evening!";
    }

    console.log(greeting);
    ```  
  

**"Timely Greeting"**


17. Log the timely greeting followed by the time:

    ```js
    let timelyGreeting = `${greeting} The time is: ${timeIs}`;
    console.log(timelyGreeting);
    ```


#### Outputting the "timely greeting" to the web page

18. Get the html element that we have for displaying the timely greeting:

  ```js
  let greetingTag = document.getElementById('greeting');
  ```

19. Set the **textContent** property of the tag object to **timelyGreeting**:

  ```js
  greetingTag.textContent = timelyGreeting;
  ```

#### Today's Date

Let's concatenate today's date from other Date Object time units.

**CHALLENGE w LEADING ZERO:**  
Generate a random 4-digit pin that can include leading 0's, 0045 can be a pin number
```js
let randInt = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10000); // 0-9999 .. turn that into: 0000-9999
let randPin = "";
```

- if randInt is 5 how many leading 0's do we need? 3 (0005)
- else if randInt is 57 how many leading 0's do we need? 2 (0057)
- else if randInt is 537 how many leading 0's do we need? 1 (0537)
- else randInt is 4537 how many leading 0's do we need? 0 (4537)

```js
console.log('randInt:', randInt, typeof(randInt)); // randInt: 678 number
console.log('randPin:', randPin, typeof(randPin)); // randPin: 0678 string
```

21. Get the month, which is a number from 0-11, where Jan is 0:

  ```js
  let month = dt.getMonth();
  console.log('month', month);
  ```

22. Get the month as a string (January, February, etc). This gives us the flexibility to use the month as either a number or a day:

  ```js
  let longMonthStr = dateTime.toLocaleString('default', {month:'long'})
  console.log('monthStr:', longMonthStr);

  let shortMonthStr = ddateTime.toLocaleString('default', {month:'short'})
  console.log('shortMonthStr:', shortMonthStr);
  ```

23. Get the day of the week as a number, with Sunday being 0

  ```js
  let day = dateTime.getDay(); 
  console.log('day', day);
  ```

24. Make an array of the days of the week.

  ```js
  let daysOfTheWeek = ["Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"];
  ```

Recall that an array is a variable which stores comma-separated values inside square brackets. Also recall that we can look up an item in an array by: **array[index]**.  


27. Get the four-digit year:

  ```js
  let fullYear = dt.getFullYear();
  console.log(fullYear);
  ```

28. Concatenate today's dates:

  ```js
  let todaysDate = `${dayOfWeek}, ${monthStr} ${date}, ${fullYear}`;
  console.log(todaysDate); // Monday, March 27, 2023
  ```

29. Output today's date to the web page:

  ```js
  let todaysDateTag = document.getElementById('todays-date');
  todaysDateTag.textContent = todaysDate;
  ```

  #### Outputting the correct coffee cup image based on hour:
  We have four coffee cup images, one each for morning, afternoon and evening and another for late night ("night owl"). Expanding upon our "timely greeting" logic, we will output the correct cup to the web page.

  30. Get the img tag. It has no id, but since there's only one image we can use querySelector to get it by tag name:

  ```js
  let imgTag = document.querySelector('img');
  ```

  31. Go into the "timely greeting logic" and output the correct image:

  ```js
    if (h < 12) {
      greeting = "Good Morning!";
      imgTag.src = "images/good-morning-coffee-cup.jpg";
    } else if (h < 18) {
      greeting = "Good Afternoon!";
      imgTag.src = "images/good-afternoon-coffee-cup.jpg";
    } else {
      greeting = "Good Evening!";
      imgTag.src = "images/good-evening-coffee-cup.jpg";
    }

    console.log(greeting);
   ```
