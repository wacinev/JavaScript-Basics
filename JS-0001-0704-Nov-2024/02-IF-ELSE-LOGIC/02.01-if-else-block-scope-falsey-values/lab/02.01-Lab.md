### 02.01 Lab
Instructions:  

- Open **02.01-Lab.html** in your Editor. Write the Lab code in the **script** tags.  

1. Declare a variable called lucyIsOnline and set its value to false. Write an if-else statement:  
- if lucyIsOnline is true, console.log "Lucy is online",  
- if lucyIsOnline is false, console.log "Lucy is not online"  

2. Declare a variable price, and set it equal to 88. Write an if-else statement:  
- if price is greater than or equal to 100, console.log 'Expensive'  
- if price is less than 100, console.log 'Cheap'  

3. Add an "else if" clause to the statement:

- if price is greater than 100, console.log 'Expensive'
- if price is between 50-99, console.log 'Reasonable'
- if price is less than 50, console.log 'Cheap'

4. Declare two variables: stars and review. Set stars equal to 4 and review equal to an empty string. Write an if else-else if-else statemetn:

- if 5 stars, review is "Great"
- if 4 stars, review is "Good"
- if 3 stars, review is "Meh"
- if 2 stars, review is "Bad"
- if 1 star, review is "Awful"
- console.log review below the whole thing

5. Debug the following: 

```js
    let animal = 'cow';
    let sound = '';

    if (animal = 'dog') {
        sound = Woof;
    } elseif (animal = 'cat') {
    sound = Meow;
    } elseif (animal = 'cow') {
        sound = Moo;
    } else (Animal and sound both unknown) {
    console.log('sound + !');
    
    // desired output: Moo!
```

6. Given these variables, write an if-else with three "else if" blocks to evaluate multiple temperature ranges:

```js
    let fahrenheit = 95;
    let weather = "";
```
 
- above 90 is hot
- 70-89 is warm
- 50-69 is cool
- 32-49 is cold
- below 32 is freezing
