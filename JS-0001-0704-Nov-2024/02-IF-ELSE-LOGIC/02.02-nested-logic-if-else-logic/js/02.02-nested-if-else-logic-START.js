/* Lesson 02.02 - START

// - nested if-else logic
// - truthy-falsey values

// nested if-else logic

// Consider if-else logic involving a planned activity: 

// - if it's rainy, let's go to the museum.
// - else if it's sunny, let's go to the beach
// - else it's neither rainy nor sunny, so let's go to the park.
    
// But what if there are also wind conditions that will determine what activities we engage in once we reach our destination. This requires nested if-else logic.

// 1. Declare two variables: a string and a boolean:
let weather;

// 2. Set up the non-nested logic, where we consider the weather, but not the wind conditions:

// 3. Make the weather "sunny" so that the "else if" part runs:

// 4. Make the weather "cloudy" so that the "else" part runs:

// nested if-else

// The wind don't much matter at the museum, but does at the beach and park. If it's windy at the beach, we will go windsurfing; otherwise we'll play frisbee.

// 5. Add a nested if-else to specify what to do at the beach, based on the wind:

// 6. Moving on to the last part, specify what to do at the park based on the wind:

// 7. Change the values of weather and windy to get different output.

Lab 02.02

1. Write nested if-else logic that considers whether today is a weekday, weekend or holiday, as well or if you're a student or not. Depending on the variable values, the logic should log one of six different strings:

    - if it's a weekday and student is true: "Go to school!"
    - if it's a weekday and student is false: "Go to work!"
    - if it's the weekend and student is true: "Keg Party!"
    - if it's the weekend and student is false: "Happy Hour!"
    - if it's a holiday and student is true: "Road trip!"
    - if it's a holiday and student is false: "Backyard BBQ!"

2. Write a nested if-else block, that satisfies the following conditions:

    - If the student score is greater than or equal to 90, if the student is in high school, they get a grade of "A", but if they are in college they get a grade of 4.

    - If the student score is greater than or equal to 80 and less than 90, if the student is in high school, they get a grade of "B", but if they are in college they get a grade of 3.

    - If the student score is greater than or equal to 70 and less than 80, if the student is in high school, they get a grade of "C", but if they are in college they get a grade of 2.

    - If the student score is greater than or equal to 65 and less than 70, if the student is in high school, they get a grade of "D", but if they are in college they get a grade of 1.

    - Else the grade is "FAIL" for both high school and college.

3. Write a nested if-else block, that calculates the price of a pet, 
   based on the following conditions:

    - If the pet is a cat, increase the pet price by 20%, unless it is a kitten (baby cat), in which case decrease the price by 10%.

    - If the pet is a dog, increase the pet price by 30%, unless it is a puppy (baby dog), in which case decrease the price by 15%.

    - If the pet is anything besides a dog or a cat, double the price, unless it is a baby version of the pet, in which case cut the price in half.
