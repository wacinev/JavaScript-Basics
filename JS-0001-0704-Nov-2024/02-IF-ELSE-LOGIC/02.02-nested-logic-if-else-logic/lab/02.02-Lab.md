Lab 02.02 - Instructions:  

1. Write a nested if-else block, that satisfies the following conditions:

    - If the student score is greater than or equal to 90, if the student is in high school, they get a grade of "A", but if they are in college they get a grade of 4.
    - If the student score is greater than or equal to 80 and less than 90, if the student is in high school, they get a grade of "B", but if they are in college they get a grade of 3.
    - If the student score is greater than or equal to 70 and less than 80, if the student is in high school, they get a grade of "C", but if they are in college they get a grade of 2.
    - If the student score is greater than or equal to 65 and less than 70, if the student is in high school, they get a grade of "D", but if they are in college they get a grade of 1.
    - Else the grade is "FAIL" for both high school and college.

2. Write a nested if-else block, that calculates the price of a bet, based on the following conditions:

    - If the pet is a cat, increase the pet price by 20%, unless it is a kitten (baby cat), in which case decrease the price by 10%.
    - If the pet is a dog, increase the pet price by 30%, unless it is a puppy (baby dog), in which case decrease the price by 15%.
    - If the pet is anything besides a dog or a cat, double the price, unless it is a baby version of the pet, in which case cut the price in half.
