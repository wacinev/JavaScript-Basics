1. Write a nested if-else block, that satisfies the following conditions: 

1. Write a nested if-else block, that satisfies the following conditions:

    - If the student score is greater than or equal to 90, if the student is in high school, they get a grade of "A", but if they are in college they get a grade of 4.
    - If the student score is greater than or equal to 80 and less than 90, if the student is in high school, they get a grade of "B", but if they are in college they get a grade of 3.
    - If the student score is greater than or equal to 70 and less than 80, if the student is in high school, they get a grade of "C", but if they are in college they get a grade of 2.
    - If the student score is greater than or equal to 65 and less than 70, if the student is in high school, they get a grade of "D", but if they are in college they get a grade of 1.
    - Else the grade is "FAIL" for both high school and college.

    ```js
    let score = 94;
    let highSchool = true;
    let grade;

    if(score >= 90) {
        if(highSchool) {
            grade = "A";
        } else {
            grade = 4;
        }
    } else if(score >= 80) {
        if(highSchool) {
            grade = "B";
        } else {
            grade = 3;
        }
    } else if(score >= 70) {
        if(highSchool) {
            grade = "C";
        } else {
            grade = 2;
        }
    } else {
        grade = "FAIL";
    }

    console.log(grade);
    ```

2. Write a nested if-else block, that calculates the price of a bet, based on the following conditions:

    - If the pet is a cat, increase the pet price by 20%, unless it is a kitten (baby cat), in which case decrease the price by 10%.
    - If the pet is a dog, increase the pet price by 30%, unless it is a puppy (baby dog), in which case decrease the price by 15%.
    - If the pet is anything besides a dog or a cat, double the price, unless it is a baby version of the pet, in which case cut the price in half.

    ```js
    let pet = "cat";
    let price = 100;
    let baby = true;

    if(pet == "cat") {
        if(baby) {
            price *= 0.9; // to decrease by 10%, multiply by 0.9
        } else {
            price *= 1.2; // to increase by 20%, multiply by 1.2
        }
    } else if(pet == "dog") {
        if(baby) {
            price *= 0.85; // to decrease by 15%, multiply by 0.85
        } else {
            price *= 1.3; // to increase by 30%, multiply by 1.3
        }
    } else {
        if(baby) {
            price *= 0.5; // to decrease by half (50%), multiply by 0.5
        } else {
            price *= 2; // to double a number, multiply it by 2
        }
    }

    console.log(price);
    ```
