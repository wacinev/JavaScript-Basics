/* 
Limitation of forEach ðŸš«

1. break in forEach
A key limitation of forEach is the inability to stop or break the loop using traditional control statements like break or return. If you try to use break inside a forEach, you'll encounter a syntax error because break is not applicable within a callback function.

Attempting to Break forEach

Typically, a break statement is used to exit a loop prematurely when a certain condition is met.
*/

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    // break; // Syntax Error: Illegal break statement


/* 
When you try to use break in a forEach loop, JavaScript throws a syntax error. This is because break is designed to be used in traditional loops (like for, while, do...while) and is not recognized within the callback function of forEach.

2. return in forEach
In other loops or functions, the return statement exits the loop or function, returning a value if specified.

In the context of forEach, return does not break out of the loop. Instead, it merely exits the current iteration of the callback function and moves on to the next element in the array.

Attempting to return forEach:
*/

const nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    // Exits only the current iteration

/*  Output
    1
    2
    4
    5


In this example, return skips the printing of 3, but the loop continues with the remaining elements...

...Alternatives to forEach for Breaking Loops ðŸ’¡

Using the for...of Loop
The for...of loop, introduced in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015), offers a modern, clean, and readable way to iterate over iterable objects like arrays, strings ... and more. 

Advantages of for...of:
Flexibility: Allows the use of break, continue, and return statements.
Versatility: Capable of iterating over a wide range of iterable objects, not just arrays.

Practical Example with for...of
Consider the following scenario where we need to process elements of an array until a certain condition is met:
*/

const numz = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// Successfully breaks the loop
  
  console.log();

/* Output:
   1
   2
   3
*/
