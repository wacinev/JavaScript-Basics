const animals = [

  "cat",
  "dog",

  "frog",
  "giraffe",
  "hedgehog",
  "iguana",
  "lynx",
  "manatee",
];
```

``` js
const vowels = "aeiou";
```

1. Use the find() method to find the first animal that starts with a vowel.

2. Use the findIndex() method to find the index of the first animal that *ends* in a vowel.

3. Use findIndex() to find the index of the first number whose square root is an integer.

``` js
const digits = [8, 16, 32, 75, 100, 256];
```

4. Use find() to find the first number that is double the number before it:

HINT: Use all three available callback arguments: the element, the index, and the array
